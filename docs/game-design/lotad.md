# Lotad - Rebalance Notes

## Design Philosophy
Lotad is being built as a **Rain Dish stalling specialist** - a defensive Pokemon that heals in rain while draining HP and setting up hazards.

## Stat Changes

**Stats (Unchanged):**
- HP: 40
- Attack: 30
- Defense: 30
- Speed: 30
- Special Attack: 40
- Special Defense: 50
- Rationale: Stats are fine for early game defensive staller

## Ability Changes

**Primary Ability:**
- Vanilla: Swift Swim (ability 1)
- Rebalanced: **Rain Dish** (swapped to ability 1)
- Rationale: Heals 1/16 HP every turn in rain, synergizes with stall strategy

## Moveset Changes

**New Learnset Strategy:**
- **Early:** Absorb (7) - Basic draining move
- **Early:** Leech Seed (8) - Passive HP drain
- **Early:** Rain Dance (10) - Activates Rain Dish healing
- **Mid:** Mega Drain (12) - Stronger HP drain
- **Mid:** Flip Turn (15) - Pivot utility, maintains momentum
- **Mid:** Aqua Ring (18) - Additional passive healing
- **Late:** Giga Drain (24) - Powerful HP drain

**Target Levels (8, 12, 14 guideline):**
- Level 8: Leech Seed (passive drain)
- Level 10: Rain Dance (Rain Dish activation)
- Level 12: Mega Drain (strong HP drain)
- Level 15: Flip Turn (bonus pivot move)

## Core Strategy

**The Rain Dish Stall Machine:**
1. Set up Rain Dance
2. Rain Dish heals 1/16 HP per turn
3. Use Leech Seed for passive damage + healing
4. Aqua Ring adds more passive healing
5. Mega Drain/Giga Drain for active HP recovery
6. Flip Turn to pivot out when needed

**Why This Works:**
- Rain Dance activates Rain Dish (1/16 HP heal per turn)
- Leech Seed drains opponent's HP (1/8 per turn)
- Aqua Ring heals 1/16 HP per turn
- Mega Drain/Giga Drain actively steal HP
- Combined: massive HP recovery per turn
- Water/Grass typing gives good defensive coverage

## Competitive Niche
- Rain team staller/tank
- Leech Seed + Rain Dish + Aqua Ring = passive healing tank
- Flip Turn pivot utility
- Early-game defensive wall with sustain

## Synergy Notes
- Rain Dance + Rain Dish = 1/16 HP heal per turn
- Leech Seed + Rain Dish + Aqua Ring = massive passive healing
- Mega Drain/Giga Drain for active HP recovery
- Flip Turn maintains momentum when you need to switch
- Water/Grass typing resists Water, Ground, Rock, Steel

## Strategy Combinations

**Full Sustain Mode:**
- Set up Rain Dance (Rain Dish active)
- Use Leech Seed on opponent
- Set up Aqua Ring
- Spam Mega Drain/Giga Drain
- Total healing per turn: Rain Dish (1/16) + Aqua Ring (1/16) + Leech Seed (1/8) + Drain moves = nearly unkillable

**Pivot Strategy:**
- Set up Rain Dance
- Use Leech Seed
- Flip Turn out to maintain momentum
- Bring Lotad back later to repeat

**Rain Team Support:**
- Sets up Rain Dance for Swift Swim teammates (Poliwag, Surskit)
- Rain Dish keeps it healthy while supporting team
- Flip Turn pivots into sweepers

## Matchup Analysis
- **Strong vs:** Water, Ground, Rock (resists), slow attackers (stalling)
- **Weak vs:** Flying, Poison, Bug (4Ã— Bug weakness!)
- **Role:** Defensive rain staller, passive healing tank, pivot

## Design Notes
Lotad becomes a **stalling machine** in rain:
- Rain Dish provides constant healing
- Leech Seed + Aqua Ring stack passive healing
- Drain moves provide active healing
- Flip Turn gives pivot utility
- Water/Grass typing is defensively solid

**The Healing Math:**
Per turn with full setup in rain:
- Rain Dish: 1/16 max HP
- Aqua Ring: 1/16 max HP
- Leech Seed: 1/8 opponent's max HP
- Mega/Giga Drain: 50-75% of damage dealt
- **Total: ~25% HP recovered per turn minimum**

This makes Lotad an incredibly annoying early-game staller that's nearly impossible to KO once set up!
