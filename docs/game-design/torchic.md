# Torchic/Blaziken - Rebalance Notes

## Design Philosophy
Torchic is being transformed into a **Speed Boost physical kicking machine** that can either sweep directly with powerful kicks or set up and pass stat boosts to teammates with Baton Pass. A glass cannon that gets faster every turn and specializes in Fighting-type kick moves.

## Stat Changes

### Torchic
**Before:**
- HP: 45
- Attack: 60
- Defense: 40
- Speed: 45
- SpA: 70
- SpD: 50
- Total: 310

**After:**
- HP: 45
- **Attack: 70** (+10)
- **Defense: 39** (-1) - Glass cannon!
- **Speed: 55** (+10) → **65, 75, 85...** with Speed Boost!
- **SpA: 40** (-30) - Pure physical
- **SpD: 49** (-1) - Glass cannon!
- Total: 298

**Rationale:** Glass cannon physical attacker. Speed Boost compensates for defenses. All-in on Attack and Speed.

### Combusken
**Before:**
- HP: 60, Atk: 85, Def: 60, Spe: 55, SpA: 85, SpD: 60
- Total: 405

**After:**
- HP: 60
- **Attack: 95** (+10)
- **Defense: 54** (-6) - Glass cannon!
- **Speed: 70** (+15) → **80, 90, 100...** with Speed Boost!
- **SpA: 50** (-35) - Pure physical
- **SpD: 54** (-6) - Glass cannon!
- Total: 383

**Rationale:** High attack, low defenses. Relies on Speed Boost to outspeed and KO before getting hit.

### Blaziken
**Before:**
- HP: 80, Atk: 120, Def: 70, Spe: 80, SpA: 110, SpD: 70
- Total: 530

**After:**
- HP: 80
- **Attack: 130** (+10) - Elite physical attacker!
- **Defense: 60** (-10) - Glass cannon!
- **Speed: 90** (+10) → **100, 110, 120...** with Speed Boost!
- **SpA: 60** (-50) - Pure physical
- **SpD: 60** (-10) - Glass cannon!
- Total: 480

**Rationale:** Extreme glass cannon. 130 Attack is elite tier. Low defenses balanced by escalating Speed Boost. Must sweep quickly or get swept.

## Ability Changes

**Primary Ability (All Stages):**
- Vanilla: Blaze
- Rebalanced: **Speed Boost** (ability 1)

## Core Strategy

### The Speed Boost Engine

**Every turn, Speed increases by 1 stage (+50%):**
- Turn 1: 55 Speed → **82** (1.5×)
- Turn 2: 55 Speed → **110** (2×)
- Turn 3: 55 Speed → **137** (2.5×)
- Turn 4: 55 Speed → **165** (3×)

**Blaziken with Speed Boost:**
- Turn 1: 90 Speed → **135**
- Turn 2: 90 Speed → **180**
- Turn 3: 90 Speed → **225**

### Strategy 1: Baton Pass Support

**Setup then Pass:**
1. Switch in Torchic → Speed Boost +1
2. Turn 1: Detect → Speed Boost +2 (stall safely)
3. Turn 2: Bulk Up → Speed +3, Atk +1, Def +1
4. Turn 3: Baton Pass → Transfer **+3 Speed, +1 Atk, +1 Def** to teammate!

**Teammate receives:**
- +3 Speed (2.5× speed multiplier)
- +1 Attack
- +1 Defense
- Ready to sweep at insane speed!

**Best Partners:**
- Sceptile (already fast + more speed = unstoppable)
- Mudkip (tank + speed boost = perfect)
- Any sweeper that needs speed

### Strategy 2: Physical Kicking Sweeper

**Direct Sweep:**
1. Turn 1: Bulk Up → Speed +1, Atk +1, Def +1
2. Turn 2: Detect → Speed +2, keep boosts
3. Turn 3+: Spam kicks at escalating speed

**Kick Arsenal:**
- **Low Kick** (Lv 8): Variable power, good vs heavy Pokemon
- **Double Kick** (Lv 10): 2-hit, breaks Sturdy/Sash
- **Blaze Kick** (Lv 22): 85 power, high crit, Fire STAB
- **Jump Kick** (Lv 26): 100 power, risky
- **High Jump Kick** (Lv 30): 130 power ultimate kick!
- **Close Combat** (Lv 44): 120 power, lowers defenses

### Strategy 3: Hybrid Setup

**Flexible Approach:**
1. Turn 1: Bulk Up (Speed +1, setup begins)
2. Turn 2: Assess situation
   - **Winning?** → Sweep with kicks
   - **Need help?** → Baton Pass to better matchup
3. Turn 3+: Either sweep or support

**Why This Works:**
- Speed Boost makes you faster each turn regardless
- Bulk Up provides both offense and defense
- Baton Pass provides escape + support option
- Glass cannon stats force decisive play

- Turn 3: Sweep at 2× speed!

### Baton Pass Synergy:
- Transfers ALL stat boosts

- Bulk Up bonuses carry over
- Enables support role
- Can pass to better matchup

### Flame Charge Bonus:

- **Also grants +1 Speed**
- Stacks with Speed Boost!
- Turn 1: Flame Charge → +1 Speed (move) + 1 Speed (ability) = **+2 Speed total!**

## Matchup Analysis

## Example Battle Sequences

### Baton Pass Support:
```
Turn 1: Switch in → Speed Boost +1 (82 Speed)
Turn 2: Detect → Speed Boost +2 (110 Speed)
Turn 3: Bulk Up → Speed Boost +3 (137 Speed), Atk +1, Def +1
Turn 4: Baton Pass → Sceptile enters with +3 Spe, +1 Atk, +1 Def
        Sceptile now at 360 Speed with attack boost!
```

### Direct Sweep:
```
Turn 1: Bulk Up → Speed Boost +1 (135 Speed), Atk +1, Def +1
Turn 2: High Jump Kick → Speed Boost +2 (180 Speed)
Turn 3: High Jump Kick → Speed Boost +3 (225 Speed)
Turn 4: Faster than everything, keep sweeping
```

### Flame Charge Stack:

Turn 1: Flame Charge → +1 Spe (move) + 1 Spe (ability) = +2 total!
Turn 2: Flame Charge → +1 Spe (move) + 1 Spe (ability) = +4 total!
Turn 3: High Jump Kick at 3× Speed
```

### Detect Stall:
```
Turn 1: Detect (safe) → Speed Boost +1
Turn 2: Detect (safe) → Speed Boost +2
Turn 3: Bulk Up → Speed Boost +3, Atk +1, Def +1
Turn 4: Sweep at 2.5× Speed with +1 Atk
```

## Design Notes
This is an **"escalating threat"** - the combination of:
- Speed Boost (free speed every turn)
- Bulk Up (attack + defense setup)
- Detect (safe speed stacking)
- Baton Pass (transfer boosts OR swap)
- Glass cannon stats (must play aggressively)
- All kicks moveset (thematic + powerful)

Creates a Pokemon that becomes more dangerous each turn it stays alive. Opponents must KO it quickly or it becomes unstoppable. The Baton Pass option adds strategic depth - do you sweep yourself or pass to a better sweeper?

Low defenses force decisive, aggressive play. Can't stall forever - must commit to sweep or pass. High skill ceiling with multiple viable strategies.

## Recommended Items
- **Focus Sash** - Guarantees at least 1 Speed Boost
- **Salac Berry** - Speed boost when low HP (stacks with ability!)
- **Liechi Berry** - Attack boost when low HP
- **Life Orb** - More power, acceptable recoil given glass cannon nature
- **Choice Scarf** - Even faster (but locks moves)

## Strategy Tips
1. **Early game**: Use Bulk Up + Detect to stack Speed Boost safely
2. **Mid game**: Choose to sweep with kicks OR Baton Pass to better matchup
3. **Late game**: Blaziken with +3 Speed sweeps nearly everything
4. **Glass cannon**: Accept you'll get OHKO'd - make each turn count
5. **Baton Pass timing**: Pass when facing bad matchup but have good boosts
6. **Kick selection**: High Jump Kick for power, Double Kick vs Sturdy, Close Combat when can't afford to miss
