# Toxapex - Rebalance Notes

## Design Philosophy
Toxapex is being transformed into an ultimate defensive stall tank with Poison Heal ability, creating a self-sustaining defensive wall that heals while outlasting opponents.

## Encounter Location

**Route 104 - Water Encounters (Surfing):**
- Level 5-8
- Encounter Rate: 4 (standard water encounter rate)
- Available very early in the game

## Stat Changes

**No Changes Needed:**
- Vanilla stats are already excellent for its defensive role
- High Defense and Special Defense
- Low Speed fits the stall playstyle

## Ability Changes

**Primary Ability:**
- Vanilla: Merciless / Limber
- Rebalanced: **Poison Heal** (ability 1)
- Rationale: Heals 1/8 HP per turn when poisoned - creates self-sustaining tank

## Moveset Changes

**New Learnset Strategy:**
- **Early:** Toxic Spikes (early hazard setting)
- **Early:** Toxic (apply poison to opponents)
- **Mid:** Venoshock (doubles damage on poisoned targets)
- **Mid:** Baneful Bunker (protection + poison on contact)
- **Mid:** Rain Dance (weather control, synergizes with water team)
- **Mid:** Whirlpool (trap + chip damage)
- **Mid-Late:** Aqua Ring (additional healing)

## Core Strategy

**The Poison Heal Tank:**
1. Get yourself poisoned (via Toxic Orb item)
2. Poison Heal heals you 1/8 HP per turn
3. Use Toxic/Toxic Spikes to poison opponents
4. Stall with Baneful Bunker and high defense
5. Attack with Venoshock (2x power on poisoned targets)
6. Aqua Ring + Poison Heal = massive healing per turn

**Why This Works:**
- Poison Heal turns poison damage into healing
- Toxic Orb + Poison Heal = consistent recovery
- Aqua Ring stacks with Poison Heal for even more sustain
- Baneful Bunker protects while poisoning attackers
- Venoshock hits hard against poisoned opponents

## Competitive Niche
- Ultimate defensive stall tank
- Hazard setter (Toxic Spikes)
- Self-sustaining with Poison Heal + Aqua Ring
- Whirlpool for trapping opponents
- Rain Dance support for water teams

## Strategy Combinations

**Defensive Stall:**
- Poison Heal + Toxic Orb
- Aqua Ring for extra healing
- Baneful Bunker for protection
- Toxic opponents and wait

**Offensive Stall:**
- Toxic Spikes on switch-in
- Toxic individual threats
- Venoshock for heavy damage on poisoned targets
- Whirlpool to trap and chip

**Team Support:**
- Rain Dance for rain teams
- Toxic Spikes for passive damage
- Defensive pivot with massive bulk

## Synergy Notes
- Toxic Orb is essential for activating Poison Heal
- Aqua Ring + Poison Heal = healing ~3/16 HP per turn (nearly 20%!)
- Whirlpool + Toxic = trapped opponents taking damage every turn
- Rain Dance supports Poliwag's Swift Swim strategy
- Water typing counters Sandstorm gym's Rock types

## First Gym Strategy

Toxapex fits into the **Poison & Tank** recommended strategy:
- Use defensive bulk to survive sandstorm chip damage
- Poison Heal negates sandstorm damage
- Apply Toxic/Toxic Spikes for passive damage
- Water typing resists Rock moves
- Outlast opponents through superior sustain

## Matchup Analysis
- **Strong vs:** Physical attackers, Rock, Ground, Fire
- **Weak vs:** Electric, Psychic, Ground
- **Role:** Defensive tank, hazard setter, stall specialist
