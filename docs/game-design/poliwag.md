# Poliwag - Rebalance Notes

## Design Philosophy
Poliwag is being rebalanced to be a rain-based special attacker rather than a physical attacker. This creates early-game synergy with rain teams and emphasizes its Swift Swim ability.

## Stat Changes

**Special Attack:**
- Vanilla: 40
- Rebalanced: **70** (+30)
- Rationale: Make it a viable special attacker early game

**Attack:**
- Vanilla: 50
- Rebalanced: **40** (-10)
- Rationale: Shift focus away from physical attacks

**HP:**
- No change (40)

## Ability Changes

**Primary Ability:**
- Vanilla: Water Absorb / Damp
- Rebalanced: **Swift Swim** (ability 1)
- Rationale: Synergizes with Rain Dance in moveset, creates rain team strategy

## Moveset Changes

**New Learnset:**
- Level 1: Hypnosis
- Level 1: Pound
- Level 8: Mud Shot (moved from later level)
- Level 10: Rain Dance (NEW)
- Level 12: Water Pulse (NEW)
- Level 14: Rain Dance (duplicate entry - may need clarification)
- Later levels: TBD (will revisit for late-game viability)

**Strategy:**
1. Hypnosis for disruption
2. Rain Dance to activate Swift Swim
3. Water Pulse as primary STAB special attack
4. Mud Shot for coverage

## Competitive Niche
- Early-game rain sweeper
- Speed control with Swift Swim
- Sleep support with Hypnosis
- Special attacking water type for early routes

## Future Improvements Needed
- Later level moves need rebalancing
- Consider evolution stat progression
- Ensure Poliwhirl/Poliwrath maintain this special attack focus or diverge intentionally
