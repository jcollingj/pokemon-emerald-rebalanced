# Treecko/Sceptile - Rebalance Notes

## Design Philosophy
Treecko is being transformed into a **physical Unburden sweeper** that uses item consumption to double its speed and sweep with powerful physical grass, dragon, and fighting moves. A unique speed demon that rewards strategic item usage.

## Stat Changes

### Treecko
**Before:**
- HP: 40
- Attack: 45
- Defense: 35
- Speed: 70
- SpA: 65
- SpD: 55
- Total: 310

**After:**
- HP: 40
- **Attack: 55** (+10)
- **Defense: 40** (+5)
- **Speed: 75** (+5) → **150 with Unburden!**
- **SpA: 50** (-15)
- **SpD: 50** (-5)
- Total: 310

**Rationale:** Shifted to physical attacking with higher speed. Unburden doubles speed after consuming held item.

### Grovyle
**Before:**
- HP: 50, Atk: 65, Def: 45, Spe: 95, SpA: 85, SpD: 65
- Total: 405

**After:**
- HP: 50
- **Attack: 75** (+10)
- **Defense: 50** (+5)
- **Speed: 100** (+5) → **200 with Unburden!**
- **SpA: 60** (-25)
- **SpD: 60** (-5)
- Total: 395

**Rationale:** Pure physical attacker that becomes incredibly fast with Unburden.

### Sceptile
**Before:**
- HP: 70, Atk: 85, Def: 65, Spe: 120, SpA: 105, SpD: 85
- Total: 530

**After:**
- HP: 70
- **Attack: 105** (+20)
- **Defense: 70** (+5)
- **Speed: 120** (same) → **240 with Unburden!!**
- **SpA: 75** (-30)
- **SpD: 90** (+5)
- Total: 530

**Rationale:** Elite physical attacker with insane speed potential. 240 Speed with Unburden makes it the fastest sweeper in the game.

## Core Strategy

### The Unburden Combo

**Turn 1 Options:**

**Option 1: Flying Gem + Acrobatics**
1. Hold Flying Gem
2. Use Acrobatics → 55 × 1.5 (STAB) × 1.3 (Gem) = **107 effective power**
3. Gem consumed → Unburden activates → **Speed doubles!**
4. Turn 2+: Acrobatics with no item = 110 × 1.5 = **165 effective power** at 2× speed!

**Option 2: Power Herb + Solar Blade**
1. Hold Power Herb
2. Use Solar Blade → Instant 125 power (normally charges)
3. Herb consumed → Unburden activates → **Speed doubles!**
4. Turn 2+: Sweep with Acrobatics/Leaf Blade at 2× speed

**Option 3: Salac Berry + Stuff Cheeks**
1. Hold Salac Berry (Speed boost at 25% HP)
2. Use Stuff Cheeks → Eat berry instantly, +2 Defense
3. Berry consumed → Unburden activates → **Speed doubles + stat boosts!**

**Turn 2+ Sweep:**

### Speed Tiers with Unburden

- **Grovyle:** 100 → **200** (insanely fast)
- **Sceptile:** 120 → **240** (fastest Pokemon in the game!)

## Competitive Niche
- Physical speed demon with Unburden gimmick
- Item consumption creates unique strategic choices
- Grass/Flying/Dragon/Fighting coverage hits most types
- Early power spike with Stuff Cheeks + Acrobatics
- Flexible item options (Gems, Berries, Power Herb)

## Synergy Notes

### Items That Trigger Unburden:
1. **Flying Gem** - Boosts Acrobatics, then consumed
2. **Normal Gem** - Boosts Quick Attack
3. **Power Herb** - Makes Solar Blade instant
4. **Salac Berry** - Speed boost + Unburden
5. **Liechi Berry** - Attack boost + Unburden
6. **White Herb** - Negates stat drops (Leaf Storm synergy)
7. **Any Berry** + Stuff Cheeks - Instant consumption

### Stuff Cheeks Combo:
- Eats any berry immediately
- Grants +2 Defense
- Triggers Unburden instantly
- Bulky fast sweeper setup!

### Solar Blade + Power Herb:
- Normally charges turn 1, attacks turn 2
- Power Herb makes it instant 125 power
- Herb consumed → Unburden activates
- Best turn 1 setup move

### Acrobatics Scaling:
- With item: 55 power
- No item: 110 power
- After consuming Gem: 110 power + already got Gem boost
- Perfect Unburden synergy

Turn 4: Clean up at blazing speed
```

### Defensive Setup:
```
Turn 1: Stuff Cheeks (Salac Berry) → +2 Def, Unburden activates

## Design Notes
This is a **"strategic item user"** - the combination of:
- Unburden (speed doubling)
- Item consumption moves (Stuff Cheeks)
- Item-boosted moves (Acrobatics, Solar Blade)
- Multiple item choices (Gems, Berries, Herbs)

Creates a Pokemon with high skill ceiling and multiple playstyles. The player must choose their item and strategy before battle, then execute the combo perfectly. Rewards planning and timing.
