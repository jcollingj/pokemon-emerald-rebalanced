# Taillow - Rebalance Notes

## Design Philosophy
Taillow is being completely reimagined as a **defensive tank** with Guts ability - the opposite of what you'd expect from a small bird. This creates a unique early-game wall that gets stronger when statused.

## Stat Changes

**HP:**
- Vanilla: 40
- Rebalanced: **70** (+30)
- Rationale: Tank needs bulk to survive

**Defense:**
- Vanilla: 30
- Rebalanced: **70** (+40)
- Rationale: Physical wall capability

**Special Defense:**
- Vanilla: 30
- Rebalanced: **70** (+40)
- Rationale: Mixed defensive wall

**Attack:**
- Vanilla: 55
- Rebalanced: **Keep medium** (~55-60)
- Rationale: Still needs to do damage with Guts boost

**Speed:**
- Vanilla: 85
- Rebalanced: **Lower to ~50** (-35)
- Rationale: Tanks don't need speed, encourages defensive play

## Ability Changes

**Primary Ability:**
- Vanilla: Guts (already has it as option)
- Rebalanced: **Guts** (ability 1)
- Rationale: Attack boost when statused synergizes with tank role

## Moveset Changes

**New Learnset Strategy:**
- **Early:** Pluck (early Flying STAB with item removal)
- **Early:** Wing Attack (consistent Flying STAB)
- **Mid:** Roost (healing for sustain)
- **Mid:** Tailwind (team support)
- **Mid:** Whirlwind (phazing/hazard support)
- **Mid-Late:** Substitute (Guts synergy with status)

**Target Levels (8, 12, 14 guideline):**
- Level 8: Pluck
- Level 12: Wing Attack
- Level 14: Roost
- Level 18: Tailwind
- Level 22: Whirlwind
- Level 28: Substitute

## Core Strategy

**The Tank Guts Combo:**
1. Get yourself statused (Toxic Orb/Flame Orb)
2. Guts boosts Attack by 50% when statused
3. Use Substitute to protect yourself
4. Roost to heal off damage
5. Whirlwind to force switches and rack up hazard damage
6. Tailwind for team support

**Why This Works:**
- 70/70/70 bulk makes it incredibly hard to KO
- Guts + status = 1.5x Attack boost
- Roost keeps it healthy
- Substitute protects from status moves and revenge kills
- Whirlwind forces opponents into hazards
- Medium Attack + Guts boost = respectable damage

## Competitive Niche
- Early-game defensive wall
- Guts-boosted attacker despite defensive stats
- Team support with Tailwind and Whirlwind
- Roost + Substitute for longevity
- Unique "tank bird" archetype

## Strategy Combinations

**Defensive Tank:**
- Flame Orb/Toxic Orb for Guts
- Roost for recovery
- Whirlwind to force switches
- Substitute to block status/revenge kills

**Support Tank:**
- Set up Tailwind for team
- Whirlwind to phaze setup sweepers
- Roost to stay healthy
- Pluck for utility (item removal)

**Guts Attacker:**
- Status yourself with orb
- Substitute to protect
- Wing Attack with Guts boost
- Roost to maintain health

## Synergy Notes
- Flame Orb activates Guts (1.5x Attack)
- Substitute + Roost = hard to kill
- Whirlwind forces opponents into Stealth Rock/Spikes
- Tailwind supports faster teammates
- Pluck removes berries and defensive items
- 70/70/70 bulk is exceptional for early game

## Matchup Analysis
- **Strong vs:** Physical attackers, setup sweepers (Whirlwind)
- **Weak vs:** Strong special attackers, status absorbers
- **Role:** Defensive tank, team support, Guts attacker

## Design Notes
This is a **"weird tank"** - completely unexpected from Taillow. The combination of:
- Defensive stats (70/70/70)
- Guts ability (offensive when needed)
- Support moves (Tailwind, Whirlwind)
- Sustain (Roost, Substitute)

Creates a Pokemon that's hard to predict and counter. It can wall, support, and attack all in one package.
