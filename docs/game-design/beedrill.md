# Beedrill - Rebalance Notes

## Design Philosophy
Beedrill is being transformed into a powerful poison-based physical attacker with the Merciless ability, creating devastating critical hit combos against poisoned opponents. Early-game Pokemon that remains competitive throughout.

## Stat Changes

**HP:**
- Vanilla: 65
- Rebalanced: **75** (+10)
- Rationale: Improved survivability for an early-game Pokemon

**Attack:**
- Vanilla: 90 → 80 (after Gen 6)
- Rebalanced: **90** (+10 from current)
- Rationale: High attack power to leverage critical hits from Merciless

## Ability Changes

**Primary Ability:**
- Vanilla: Swarm
- Rebalanced: **Merciless** (ability 1)
- Rationale: Auto-crits against poisoned targets - creates powerful synergy with poison moves

## Moveset Changes

**New Learnset Strategy:**
- **Early:** Poison Powder (apply poison status)
- **Early:** Poison Jab (STAB poison move that benefits from Merciless)
- **Mid:** Hone Claws or Swords Dance (setup move to boost attack)
- **Mid:** Twin Needle or Pin Missile (multi-hit moves - each hit can crit with Merciless!)
- **Mid-Late:** U-Turn (pivot utility)
- **Mid-Late:** X-Scissor (strong Bug STAB)
- **Late:** Fell Stinger (attack boost on KO)

## Core Strategy

**The Merciless Combo:**
1. Use Poison Powder to poison opponent
2. Follow up with Poison Jab - guaranteed critical hit!
3. Multi-hit moves like Pin Missile = multiple crits against poisoned targets
4. Hone Claws/Swords Dance before attacking for massive damage

**Why This Works:**
- Merciless = automatic critical hits on poisoned targets
- Poison Powder sets up the combo
- Pin Missile with Merciless = potentially 5 critical hits in one turn
- High attack stat (90) + crit multiplier = devastating damage

## Competitive Niche
- Poison setup sweeper
- Multi-hit move specialist (Pin Missile crits are insane)
- Pivot utility with U-Turn
- Setup potential with Hone Claws/Swords Dance
- Early-game accessible, late-game viable

## Synergy Notes
- Poison Powder + Merciless = guaranteed crits
- Pin Missile becomes extremely powerful (each hit crits on poisoned targets)
- Fell Stinger for snowballing after KOs
- U-Turn for momentum control
- Can poison opponents, switch out, then come back for guaranteed crits

## Multi-Hit Move Power
With Merciless, multi-hit moves become extremely powerful:
- Pin Missile: 2-5 hits × 25 base power × crit multiplier = potential 187.5-468.75 effective power
- Each hit is a guaranteed crit against poisoned targets
- Loaded Dice item would make this even more consistent

## Matchup Analysis
- **Strong vs:** Grass, Psychic, Fairy (poison coverage)
- **Weak vs:** Fire, Flying, Psychic, Rock
- **Role:** Offensive sweeper after setup, pivot with U-Turn
