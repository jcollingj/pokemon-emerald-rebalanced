# Nidoran Evolution Line - Design Recommendations

## Design Philosophy

The Nidoran line is being redesigned with a **clear gender-based split**:

### **Female Line (Nidorina/Nidoqueen) - Special Poison Setters**
- **Role:** Toxic Spikes setter → Venoshock spammer
- **Core Combo:** Toxic Spikes/Toxic → Venoshock (doubles from 65 to 130 power!)
- **Ability:** Poison Point (both stages)
- **Stat Focus:** Special Attack, HP, Special Defense
- **Strategy:** Set up poison hazards, then demolish poisoned opponents with Venoshock

### **Male Line (Nidorino/Nidoking) - Physical Bruisers**
- **Role:** Physical attacker with mixed coverage
- **Core Combo:** High Attack stat → powerful physical moves
- **Ability:** Poison Point → Sheer Force (evolution)
- **Stat Focus:** Attack, Speed, Defense
- **Strategy:** Hit hard with physical STAB and coverage moves

---

## FEMALE LINE: Nidorina (Special Poison Setter)

### Current Status
**Base Stats:**
- HP: 70, Attack: 62, Defense: 67, Speed: 56, SpA: 55, SpD: 55
- **BST: 365**

### Recommended Changes

**Stat Adjustments:**
- HP: 70 → **85** (+15)
- Attack: 62 → **50** (-12, not a physical attacker)
- Defense: 67 → **70** (+3)
- Speed: 56 → **60** (+4)
- Sp. Attack: 55 → **75** (+20, MAIN STAT)
- Sp. Defense: 55 → **75** (+20)
- **New BST: 415** (+50)

**Rationale:** Nidorina becomes a bulky special attacker that can set up Toxic Spikes and survive to spam Venoshock.

**Ability:**
- Ability 1: **Poison Point** (30% chance to poison on contact)
- Ability 2: **Poison Point** (same - consistency across line)
- Hidden: **Poison Point** (females only get this)

**Rationale:** Poison Point synergizes perfectly - even if hit by contact moves, you poison them, then Venoshock doubles in power!

**New Learnset (Toxic Spikes/Venoshock Focus):**
- Lv 1: Tackle, Growl
- Lv 6: **Poison Sting** (15 power Poison special, 30% poison)
- Lv 8: **Acid** (40 power Poison special, 10% SpD drop)
- Lv 10: **Toxic Spikes** (sets poison hazard - KEY MOVE!)
- Lv 12: **Toxic** (guaranteed poison)
- Lv 14: **Venoshock** (65 power, 130 vs poisoned - CORE MOVE!)
- Lv 18: **Sludge** (65 power Poison special, 30% poison)
- Lv 22: **Earth Power** (90 power Ground special, 10% SpD drop)
- Lv 26: **Sludge Bomb** (90 power Poison special, 30% poison)
- Lv 30: **Shadow Ball** (80 power Ghost special, 20% SpD drop)
- Lv 34: **Ice Beam** (90 power Ice special, 10% freeze)
- Lv 38: **Thunderbolt** (90 power Electric special, 10% para)
- Lv 42: **Flamethrower** (90 power Fire special, 10% burn)

### Core Strategy - Toxic Spikes + Venoshock

**Turn 1-2 Setup:**
1. **Turn 1:** Toxic Spikes (opponent and all switch-ins get poisoned!)
2. **Turn 2:** Venoshock → 130 effective power (65 × 2 vs poisoned)
3. **Every turn after:** Spam Venoshock on poisoned targets
4. **If hit by contact move:** Poison Point activates → more Venoshock targets!

**Why This Works:**
- Toxic Spikes poisons ALL enemies that switch in
- Venoshock doubles to 130 power vs poisoned targets
- With STAB: 130 × 1.5 = **195 effective power!**
- Poison Point ensures even contact attackers get poisoned
- 75 SpA + 195 effective power = massive damage
- 85/70/75 bulk lets you survive to set up

**Example Battle:**
```
Turn 1: Toxic Spikes (opponent poisoned)
Turn 2: Venoshock → 195 effective power with STAB
Turn 3: Opponent switches → new Pokemon poisoned by spikes
Turn 4: Venoshock → 195 effective power again!
Turn 5: Enemy hits with contact move → Poison Point activates
Turn 6: Venoshock → 195 effective power on freshly poisoned target
```

### Competitive Niche
- Toxic Spikes setter (passive poison on all enemies)
- Venoshock spammer (130 base power vs poisoned = better than most nukes)
- Poison Point ensures contact attackers also get poisoned
- Special coverage (Earth Power, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Flamethrower)
- Bulky enough to survive setup turns

## FEMALE LINE: Nidoqueen (Special Poison Tank)

### Current Status
**Base Stats:**
- HP: 90, Attack: 92, Defense: 87, Speed: 76, SpA: 75, SpD: 85
- **BST: 505**

### Recommended Changes

**Stat Adjustments:**
- HP: 90 → **105** (+15)
- Attack: 92 → **70** (-22, not needed)
- Defense: 87 → **95** (+8)
- Speed: 76 → **70** (-6, tanks don't need speed)
- Sp. Attack: 75 → **105** (+30, MAIN STAT)
- Sp. Defense: 85 → **100** (+15)
- **New BST: 545** (+40)

**Rationale:** Nidoqueen becomes a bulky special tank with high HP and excellent SpA for devastating Venoshock spam.

**Type:** Poison/Ground (immune to Electric, resists Rock/Poison/Bug/Fighting)

**Ability:**
- Ability 1: **Poison Point** (30% poison on contact)
- Ability 2: **Poison Point** (consistency)
- Hidden: **Sheer Force** (1.3× power on moves with secondary effects)

**Rationale:**
- Poison Point synergizes with Toxic Spikes/Venoshock strategy
- Sheer Force alternative for coverage moves (Earth Power, Ice Beam, etc.)

**New Learnset (Moon Stone Evolution):**
Upon evolution from Nidorina, learns:
- **Earth Power** (90 power Ground special STAB, 10% SpD drop)
- **Sludge Bomb** (90 power Poison special STAB, 30% poison)

Inherits Nidorina's moveset, plus:
- Lv 20: **Surf** (90 power Water special - coverage)
- Lv 24: **Ice Beam** (90 power Ice special, 10% freeze)
- Lv 28: **Thunderbolt** (90 power Electric special, 10% para)
- Lv 32: **Flamethrower** (90 power Fire special, 10% burn)
- Lv 36: **Shadow Ball** (80 power Ghost special, 20% SpD drop)
- Lv 40: **Sludge Wave** (95 power Poison special, 10% poison)
- Lv 44: **Focus Blast** (120 power Fighting special, 10% SpD drop)
- Lv 48: **Fire Blast** (110 power Fire special, 10% burn)

### Core Strategy - Tanky Venoshock Spammer

**Primary Strategy (Poison Point):**
1. **Turn 1:** Toxic Spikes (poisons all switch-ins)
2. **Turn 2+:** Venoshock spam
   - Venoshock: 65 × 2 (poisoned) × 1.5 (STAB) = **195 effective power**
   - With 105 SpA stat, this hits incredibly hard
3. **If hit by contact:** Poison Point → more Venoshock targets
4. **Tank hits** with 105/95/100 bulk

**Alternative Strategy (Sheer Force + Life Orb):**
1. Hold Life Orb
2. Use coverage moves with secondary effects:
   - Earth Power: 90 × 1.3 (Sheer) × 1.3 (Life Orb) × 1.5 (STAB) = **228 effective power, NO RECOIL!**
   - Ice Beam: 90 × 1.3 × 1.3 = **152 effective power**
   - Fire Blast: 110 × 1.3 × 1.3 = **186 effective power**
3. Coverage for everything: Poison/Ground/Fire/Ice/Electric/Fighting

**Why This Works:**
- 105 SpA is excellent for special attacking
- 105 HP / 95 Def / 100 SpD = elite bulk
- Toxic Spikes + Venoshock = 195 power STAB move
- Sheer Force variant gets insane coverage with no Life Orb recoil
- Poison/Ground typing resists common types
- Can run pure Venoshock spam OR coverage monster build

**Sample Sets:**

**Set 1: Toxic Spikes Spammer**
- Toxic Spikes
- Venoshock (195 effective vs poisoned)
- Earth Power (Ground STAB)
- Ice Beam (coverage)

**Set 2: Sheer Force Tank (Life Orb)**
- Earth Power (228 effective, no recoil)
- Sludge Wave (241 effective, no recoil)
- Ice Beam (152 effective, no recoil)
- Flamethrower/Thunderbolt (coverage)

### Competitive Niche
- Bulky special tank with elite HP/SpD
- Toxic Spikes setter → Venoshock nuker
- Sheer Force + Life Orb coverage monster
- Poison Point passive poisoning
- Resists Rock/Fighting/Bug/Poison, immune to Electric
- Perfect special wall that can hit back hard

1. Hold **Life Orb**
2. Use Sheer Force-boosted moves:
   - **Gunk Shot:** 120 × 1.3 (Sheer) × 1.3 (Life Orb) × 1.5 (STAB) = **304 effective power, NO RECOIL!**
   - **Earthquake:** 100 × 1.5 (STAB) = **150 power** (no Sheer Force, but still STAB)
   - **Rock Slide:** 75 × 1.3 × 1.3 = **127 effective power, no recoil!**
   - **Superpower:** 120 × 1.3 × 1.3 = **203 effective power, no recoil!**

1. Nidorina/Nidoqueen uses Toxic Spikes
2. All enemies that switch in are poisoned
3. Venoshock doubles to 130 power vs poisoned targets
4. With STAB: 130 × 1.5 = **195 effective power**
5. Poison Point ensures contact attackers also get poisoned
6. Spam Venoshock forever on poisoned team

**Damage Calculation:**
- Base Venoshock vs poisoned: 65 × 2 = 130
- With STAB: 130 × 1.5 = 195
- With 105 SpA Nidoqueen: Massive damage
- **Better than most 120 power moves!**

### Male Line: Sheer Force + Life Orb
**Setup:**
1. Nidoking holds Life Orb
2. Uses moves with secondary effects
3. Sheer Force: 1.3× power, removes secondary effects
4. Life Orb: 1.3× power boost
5. **Sheer Force removes Life Orb recoil!**
6. Total: 1.3 × 1.3 = 1.69× damage, no downside

**Damage Calculation:**
- Gunk Shot: 120 × 1.3 × 1.3 × 1.5 (STAB) = **304 effective power**
- Superpower: 120 × 1.3 × 1.3 = **203 effective power**
- Rock Slide: 75 × 1.3 × 1.3 = **127 effective power**
- With 120 Attack: Absolutely devastating

---

## Evolution Timing Recommendations

**When to Evolve Nidorina → Nidoqueen:**
- Evolve around **Level 25-30** when Moon Stone is available
- Immediately gains Earth Power + Sludge Bomb
- Gets massive stat boosts (especially SpA: 75 → 105)
- Can start Toxic Spikes + Venoshock spam immediately
- Best for: Special attacking teams, poison stall teams

**When to Evolve Nidorino → Nidoking:**
- Evolve around **Level 25-30** when Moon Stone is available
- Immediately gains Earthquake + Gunk Shot
- Gets huge Attack boost (85 → 120)
- Gains Sheer Force ability for Life Orb synergy
- Best for: Physical attacking teams, wallbreaking, sweeping

**Why Not Evolve Earlier?**
- Pre-evolutions learn moves faster by level-up
- Can delay evolution to get moves like Megahorn, Crunch earlier
- But stat gains are significant, so evolving at ~25-30 is recommended

---

## Team Synergies

### Nidoqueen Synergies:
- **Pairs with:** Physical attackers (she's special), Grass types (she handles Fire/Poison), hazard stackers (Stealth Rock + Toxic Spikes)
- **Counters:** Steel types (Earth Power), Fire types (Surf), Rock types (Earth Power/Surf)
- **Weak to:** Water, Psychic, Ice, Ground

### Nidoking Synergies:
- **Pairs with:** Special attackers (he's physical), Water types (he handles Electric with immunity), fast sweepers
- **Counters:** Steel types (Earthquake/Superpower), Rock types (Earthquake), Poison types (Earthquake)
- **Weak to:** Water, Psychic, Ice, Ground

---

## Success Metrics

**Player Should Feel:**
- Clear distinction between female (special) and male (physical) lines
- Nidoqueen's Toxic Spikes + Venoshock combo is devastating
- Nidoking's Sheer Force + Life Orb combo is unstoppable
- Both evolutions are equally powerful, just different playstyles
- Choosing your Nidoran gender is a meaningful decision

**Player Should NOT Feel:**
- One line is strictly better than the other
- Confused about which moves to use (special vs physical is clear)
- Outclassed by other Poison or Ground types
- Limited by movepool or lack of synergy
