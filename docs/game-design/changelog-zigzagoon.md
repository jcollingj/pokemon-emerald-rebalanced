# Changelog - Zigzagoon Redesign

**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
**Category:** Pokemon Balance, Ability Enhancement, Move Enhancement

## Summary

Zigzagoon has been redesigned as a high-risk, high-reward Belly Drum sweeper with an enhanced Pickup ability. This redesign creates memorable early-game encounters and teaches players about setup strategies and counterplay.

## Changes

### 1. Pickup Ability Enhancement

**Before:**
- Out of battle: Picks up items after battle
- In battle: No effect

**After:**
- Out of battle: Picks up items after battle (unchanged)
- **NEW In battle:** Takes half damage from attacks when at full HP and not holding an item

**Impact:**
- Enables Belly Drum setup strategy
- Creates unique "no item" playstyle
- Synergizes with Belly Drum's HP cost

### 2. Belly Drum Move Enhancement

**Before:**
- Maximize Attack (+6 stages)
- Lose 50% max HP

**After:**
- Maximize Attack (+6 stages)
- **NEW: Raise Speed (+1 stage)**
- Lose 50% max HP

**Impact:**
- Affects ALL Pokemon that use Belly Drum
- Makes Belly Drum users faster and more threatening
- Creates true setup sweeper playstyle

### 3. Zigzagoon Base Stats

| Stat    | Old | New | Change |
|---------|-----|-----|--------|
| HP      | 38  | 50  | +12    |
| Attack  | 30  | 50  | +20    |
| Defense | 41  | 45  | +4     |
| Sp.Atk  | 30  | 30  | —      |
| Sp.Def  | 41  | 45  | +4     |
| Speed   | 60  | 45  | -15    |
| **BST** | **240** | **265** | **+25** |

**Rationale:**
- More HP to survive Belly Drum
- Higher Attack for sweeping power
- Lower Speed balanced by Belly Drum boost

### 4. Zigzagoon Abilities

**Before:** Pickup / Gluttony / Quick Feet

**After:** Pickup / Quick Feet / Guts

**Changes:**
- Gluttony removed
- Guts added as Hidden Ability
- Pickup is now the signature ability

- **Belly Drum:** Level 41 → Level 14 (27 level reduction!)
- **Quick Attack:** Added at Level 7 (priority move for sweeping)
- **Sand Attack:** Level 13 → Level 4 (utility earlier)
- **Extreme Speed:** Added at Level 36 (powerful late-game option)

## Design Goals Achieved

✅ **Every Pokemon Is Viable** - Zigzagoon is now competitively viable
✅ **Strategic Battle Difficulty** - Forces players to think strategically
✅ **Memorable Encounters** - "The Belly Drum Zigzagoon" is unforgettable
✅ **Early Power Spike** - Competitive moves by level 14
✅ **Multiple Counterplay Options** - Fighting types, priority moves, status, etc.
✅ **Educational Value** - Teaches setup sweepers and counterplay

## Balance Considerations

**Strengths:**
- Devastating after successful Belly Drum setup
- Pickup allows survival of first hit
- Priority moves for revenge killing
- Multiple build options (Pickup/Quick Feet/Guts)

**Weaknesses:**
- Extremely fragile after Belly Drum (5-10 HP remaining)
- Requires no held item for maximum Pickup effectiveness
- Vulnerable to priority moves
- Walled by Fighting/Rock/Steel/Ghost types
- Can be OHKO'd by strong attackers
- Weak to status (unless Guts ability)

**Power Level:** Appropriate for early-game threat that scales into mid-game niche pick.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Trainer Battles:** Monitor early-game trainer difficulty with Belly Drum Zigzagoon
2. **Player Usage:** Track how many players catch and use Zigzagoon
3. **Counterplay:** Ensure players have access to counters (Fighting types, priority moves)
4. **AI Behavior:** Verify AI uses Belly Drum appropriately

## Related Pokemon

Consider similar treatment for:
- **Linoone** - Evolution should maintain/enhance strategy
- **Other Belly Drum users** - Now all benefit from Speed boost
- **Early Normal-types** - Ensure balanced power levels

## Future Considerations

- Belly Drum Speed boost may affect other Pokemon (Azumarill, Slurpuff, etc.)
- Monitor if +1 Speed is too strong (may reduce to +0 if oppressive)
- Consider adding Extreme Speed earlier if late-game viability needed
