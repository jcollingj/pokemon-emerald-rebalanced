## Design Philosophy Considerations

### **Pikachu's Identity:**
- **Iconic mascot** - Should feel special and viable
- **Speed-based** - 90 base speed is excellent early-game
- **Glass cannon** - Low defenses, needs to hit hard
- **Light Ball synergy** - Signature item doubles offenses

### **Current Problems:**
1. **Too fragile** - 35 HP, 30-40 defenses = dies easily
2. **Weak offenses without Light Ball** - 55/50 offenses are mediocre
3. **Limited movepool** - Mostly just electric moves
4. **Outclassed by Raichu** - Evolution is strictly better (except with Light Ball)

---

## Recommended Options

1. **Embraces Pikachu's identity** - The Light Ball is iconic
2. **Immediate power** - Transistor + Light Ball = insane damage
3. **Strategic depth** - Motor Drive for speed control vs Electric types
4. **Balanced** - Still fragile, but hits hard enough to justify it
5. **Early-game viable** - 100 Speed + Transistor makes it competitive

**Implementation:**
```
Stats: 45/65/45/60/55/100 (BST: 370)

**Synergies:**

## Alternative Simpler Buff

If you want to keep it closer to vanilla:

**Minimal Changes:**
- Stats: 45/55/45/60/55/100 (BST: 360)
- Ability 1: Static ‚Üí **Transistor**
- Ability 2: **Motor Drive**
- Hidden: Lightning Rod (keep)
- Add Volt Switch at Lv 14

This gives Pikachu a strong niche without completely reimagining it.

## Questions to Consider:

1. **Should Pikachu evolve?** If yes, how do we keep it viable as Pikachu?
2. **Light Ball dependency?** Do we want to force Light Ball usage or make it viable without?
3. **Physical vs Special?** Should it lean one direction or stay mixed?
4. **Early-game balance?** At what level should it peak in power?
5. **Raichu relationship?** Should evolution still be an upgrade, or make Pikachu competitive as-is?
