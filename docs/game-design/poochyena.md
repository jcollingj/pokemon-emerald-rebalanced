# Poochyena - Rebalance Notes

## Design Philosophy
Poochyena is being transformed into a bulky Normal/Dark type with Guts ability, creating a physical attacker that benefits from status conditions and has good bulk for early game.

## Type Changes

**Typing:**
- Vanilla: Dark
- Rebalanced: **Normal/Dark**
- Rationale: Expands coverage and gives STAB to Normal-type moves

## Stat Changes

**HP:**
- Vanilla: 35
- Rebalanced: **85** (+50)
- Rationale: Make it a bulky early-game tank

**Speed:**
- Vanilla: 35
- Rebalanced: **50** (+15)
- Rationale: Improve speed to be more competitive

## Ability Changes

**Primary Ability:**
- Vanilla: Run Away
- Rebalanced: **Guts** (ability 1)
- Rationale: Synergizes with potential self-inflicted status, boosts Attack when statused

## Moveset Changes

**New Learnset:**
- Early: Quick Attack (new STAB priority move)
- Early: Bite (keep as is)
- Mid-Early: Take Down (new powerful STAB Normal move)
- Mid: Scary Face (filler/utility)
- Mid: Howl (attack boost setup)
- Mid: Swagger (confusion + attack boost combo with own Guts)
- Mid-Late: Super Fang (consistent damage dealer)
- Late: Agility (speed control)

**Strategy:**
1. Guts ability for powered-up attacks when statused
2. Swagger to boost own attack (confusion triggers Guts if using Lum Berry or Persim Berry)
3. Take Down for strong STAB damage
4. Super Fang for consistent damage against bulky opponents
5. Howl + Agility for setup sweeping

## Competitive Niche
- Bulky early-game physical attacker
- Guts ability creates unique status synergy
- Normal/Dark typing gives broad coverage
- Setup potential with Howl/Swagger/Agility

## Synergy Notes
- Can hold Flame Orb/Toxic Orb to activate Guts
- Swagger + confusion immunity item = free attack boost
- Take Down recoil manageable with high HP stat
