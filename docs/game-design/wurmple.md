# Wurmple - Rebalance Notes

## Design Philosophy
Wurmple is being transformed into a **Technician-boosted multi-hit attacker** - a surprisingly viable early-game sweeper that gets stronger the more it hits.

## Stat Changes

**HP:**
- Vanilla: 45
- Rebalanced: **60** (+15)
- Rationale: Improved bulk to survive long enough to attack

**Attack:**
- Vanilla: 45
- Rebalanced: **60** (+15)
- Rationale: Higher attack base for Technician-boosted moves

**Defense:**
- Vanilla: 35
- Rebalanced: **50** (+15)
- Rationale: Early-game survivability

**Speed:**
- Vanilla: 20
- Rebalanced: **40** (+20)
- Rationale: Still slow but can outspeed some threats

**Special Defense:**
- Vanilla: 30
- Rebalanced: **45** (+15)
- Rationale: Balanced defensive stats

## Ability Changes

**Primary Ability:**
- Vanilla: Shield Dust
- Rebalanced: **Technician** (ability 1)
- Rationale: Boosts weak moves by 50%, making multi-hit moves devastating

## Moveset Changes

**New Learnset Strategy:**
- **Early:** Tackle (1) and String Shot (1) - basic attacks
- **Early:** Poison Sting (5) - weak poison move boosted by Technician
- **Mid:** Pin Missile (11) - multi-hit Bug STAB (2-5 hits × Technician boost!)
- **Mid:** Fury Cutter (12) - gets stronger each consecutive hit + Technician

**Target Levels (following 8, 12, 14 guideline):**
- Level 5: Poison Sting (weak move = Technician boost)
- Level 11: Pin Missile (multi-hit Bug STAB)
- Level 12: Fury Cutter (stacking damage + Technician)

## Core Strategy

**The Technician Multi-Hit Combo:**
1. Technician boosts moves with 60 power or less by 50%
2. Pin Missile hits 2-5 times, each hit boosted by Technician
3. Fury Cutter doubles in power each consecutive hit + Technician boost
4. Poison Sting becomes stronger with Technician

**Why This Works:**
- Technician makes "weak" moves powerful (60 × 1.5 = 90 effective power)
- Pin Missile: 25 power × 1.5 Technician = 37.5 per hit × 2-5 hits = 75-187.5 total damage!
- Fury Cutter: 40 × 1.5 = 60 power, doubles to 120, then 240, then 480!
- 60 Attack + Technician boost = respectable damage output
- Higher HP/Def/SpD (60/50/45) allows it to set up Fury Cutter

## Competitive Niche
- Technician-boosted multi-hit attacker
- Early-game sweeper potential
- Fury Cutter snowball strategy
- Surprisingly viable for a "weak" early Bug

## Strategy Combinations

**Pin Missile Spam:**
- Multi-hit STAB with Technician boost
- Each hit has 50% boost from Technician
- Can break Substitutes and Focus Sash
- 2-5 hits means unpredictable but powerful

**Fury Cutter Snowball:**
- Start with Technician-boosted 60 power
- Doubles each hit: 60 → 120 → 240 → 480
- Needs to keep hitting same target to stack
- Devastating if it ramps up

**Technician Coverage:**
- Tackle: 40 × 1.5 = 60 effective power
- Poison Sting: 15 × 1.5 = 22.5 (+ poison chance)
- String Shot: Speed control, doesn't benefit from Technician

## Synergy Notes
- Technician ability makes every weak move 50% stronger
- Pin Missile multi-hit benefits massively from Technician
- Fury Cutter stacking + Technician = exponential growth
- 60 Attack is enough to threaten with boosted moves
- Improved bulk (60 HP, 50 Def, 45 SpD) allows multiple attacks

## Matchup Analysis
- **Strong vs:** Grass, Psychic, Dark (Bug coverage)
- **Weak vs:** Fire, Flying, Rock
- **Role:** Technician multi-hit sweeper, Fury Cutter setup

## Design Notes
This transforms Wurmple from "completely useless" to "surprisingly threatening." The Technician + multi-hit combination creates a unique early-game attacker:
- Pin Missile becomes a powerful STAB move with Technician
- Fury Cutter can snowball into a devastating sweeper
- Improved stats make it actually usable
- Still evolves early, so it's a temporary powerhouse

**The Math:**
- Pin Missile: 25 base power × 1.5 Technician = 37.5 per hit
  - Minimum (2 hits): 75 total damage
  - Maximum (5 hits): 187.5 total damage
- Fury Cutter progression with Technician:
  - Hit 1: 40 × 1.5 = 60
  - Hit 2: 80 × 1.5 = 120
  - Hit 3: 160 × 1.5 = 240
  - Hit 4+: Capped at 160 base, but still 240 with Technician

This creates a legitimately scary early-game Bug-type!
