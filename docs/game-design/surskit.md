# Surskit - Rebalance Notes

## Design Philosophy
Surskit is being transformed into a fast special attacking Bug/Water type with Swift Swim, creating a powerful rain sweeper that can snowball with setup moves.

## Stat Changes

**HP:**
- Vanilla: 40
- Rebalanced: **75** (+35)
- Rationale: Improved survivability to enable setup sweeping

**Special Attack:**
- Vanilla: 50
- Rebalanced: **90** (+40)
- Rationale: High special attack makes it a genuine offensive threat early game

**Other Stats:**
- Keep existing Speed (65) - becomes 130 in rain with Swift Swim!
- Defense and Sp.Def stay low - glass cannon archetype

## Ability Changes

**Primary Ability:**
- Vanilla: Swift Swim (already has it)
- Rebalanced: **Swift Swim** (ability 1, confirmed)
- Rationale: Doubles Speed in rain, synergizes perfectly with Rain Dance strategies

## Moveset Changes

**New Learnset Strategy:**
- **Early:** Silver Wind (early special Bug STAB)
- **Early:** Signal Beam (stronger Bug STAB)
- **Mid:** Flip Turn (pivot utility, already added at level 15)
- **Mid:** Bug Buzz (powerful late-game Bug STAB)
- **Late:** Tail Glow (massive +3 SpA setup move!)
- **Evolution:** Quiver Dance (when evolving to Masquerain)

**Target Levels (8, 12, 14 guideline):**
- Level 8-12: Silver Wind
- Level 12-14: Signal Beam
- Level 15: Flip Turn (already set)
- Level 30+: Bug Buzz
- Level 40+: Tail Glow

## Core Strategy

**The Rain Sweeper:**
1. Set up Rain Dance (teammate or self)
2. Swift Swim doubles Speed (65 → 130!)
3. Use Tail Glow for +3 Special Attack
4. Sweep with 90 base SpA + Tail Glow boost + STAB moves
5. Flip Turn to pivot out when needed

**Why This Works:**
- Swift Swim in rain makes it incredibly fast
- 90 Special Attack + Tail Glow = devastating power
- Bug/Water coverage hits many types
- Flip Turn maintains momentum
- High HP (75) allows it to set up

## Evolution Bonus

**Masquerain:**
- Learns Quiver Dance immediately upon evolution
- This creates a choice: evolve for Quiver Dance, or stay Surskit for higher speed in rain
- Adds strategic depth to evolution timing

## Competitive Niche
- Rain team sweeper/setup Pokemon
- Early-game special attacker with late-game relevance
- Pivot utility with Flip Turn
- Tail Glow makes it a late-game threat despite being early-game Pokemon

## Synergy Notes
- Rain Dance + Swift Swim = 130 effective Speed
- Pairs perfectly with Poliwag (also Swift Swim + Rain Dance)
- Tail Glow turns it into a genuine sweeper
- Silver Wind early → Signal Beam mid → Bug Buzz late progression
- Flip Turn for momentum when you can't sweep

## Matchup Analysis
- **Strong vs:** Grass, Psychic, Dark (Bug coverage)
- **Weak vs:** Electric, Flying, Rock
- **Role:** Fast special sweeper in rain, setup sweeper with Tail Glow
